TODO: WiFi Sentinel Improvements

1. Polish and Improve Fake AP Module
   - Refactor code for clarity and modularity.
   - Add more robust error handling (e.g., check for required tools, port conflicts).
   - Allow custom SSID lists or randomization.
   - Support more ISP/captive portal templates and allow user-contributed templates.
   - Improve cleanup: always restore network state, even on crash.
   - Add logging for all actions and captured credentials.
   - Add a status page or live log for the phishing server.

2. User Experience Enhancements
   - Add a help menu or --help flag with usage instructions.
   - Auto-detect and list available wireless interfaces at startup.
   - Add progress indicators or spinners for long-running actions.

3. Security & Ethics
   - Add a double-confirmation or explicit disclaimer before launching any attack.
   - Add a "dry run" or simulation mode for educational demos.

4. Reliability & Compatibility
   - Check for and handle port conflicts (80, 53, etc.) before starting services.
   - Detect and warn if the selected interface does not support monitor mode.
   - Add support for more WiFi adapters and OSes (if desired).

5. Logging & Reporting
   - Centralize logging (actions, errors, credentials, etc.) with timestamps.
   - Add an option to export logs or results to a file.

6. Testing & Documentation
   - Add or improve unit/integration tests for all modules.
   - Expand the README with detailed usage, troubleshooting, and module documentation.
   - Add docstrings and comments throughout the codebase.

7. Extensibility
   - Modularize attack/sniffer modules for easy addition of new features.
   - Consider a plugin system for user-contributed attacks or sniffers.
